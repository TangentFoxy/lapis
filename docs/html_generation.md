# HTML Generation

This guide is focused on using builder syntax in Lua/MoonScript to generate
HTML. If you're interested in a more traditional templating system see the
[etlua Templates guide]($root/reference/etlua_templates.html).
This mechanism for generating HTML code is mainly intended to be used with
Moonscript, but it can also be used in Lua code.


## HTML Builder Syntax

HTML templates can be written directly as MoonScript (or Lua) code. This is a
very powerful feature (inspired by [Erector](http://erector.github.io/erector/))
that gives us the ability to write templates with high composability and also
all the features of MoonScript or Lua. No need to learn a separate templating
language, you can use the full power of the language you're already using.

In the context of a HTML renderer, the environment exposes functions that
create HTML tags. The tag builder functions are generated on the fly as you
call them via a custom function environment. The output of these functions is
written into a buffer that is compiled in the end and returned as the result

Here are some examples of the HTML generation:

$dual_code{
  moon = [[
    div!                -- <div></div>
    b "Hello World"     -- <b>Hello World</b>
    div "hi<br/>"       -- <div>hi&lt;br/&gt;</div>
    text "Hi!"          -- Hi!
    raw "<br/>"         -- <br/>

    element "table", width: "100%", ->  -- <table width="100%"></table>

    div class: "footer", "The Foot"     -- <div class="footer">The Foot</div>

    input required: true                -- <input required/>

    div ->                              -- <div>Hey</div>
      text "Hey"

    div class: "header", ->             -- <div class="header"><h2>My Site</h2>
      h2 "My Site"                      --    <p>Welcome!</p></div>
      p "Welcome!"
  ]],
  lua = [[
    div()                     -- <div></div>
    b("Hello World")          -- <b>Hello World</b>
    div("hi<br/>")            -- <div>hi&lt;br/&gt;</div>
    text("Hi!")               -- Hi!
    raw("<br/>")              -- <br/>
    br()                      -- <br/>

    element("table", {
      width = "100%"
    })                        -- <table width="100%"></table>

    div({
      class = "footer"
    }, "The Foot")            -- <div class="footer">The Foot</div>

    input({
      required = true
    })                        -- <input required />

    div(function()
      text("Hey")
    end)                      -- <div>Hey</div>

    div({
      class = "header"
    }, function()
      h2("My Site")
      p("Welcome!")
    end)                      -- <div class="header"><h2>My Site</h2>
                              --    <p>Welcome!</p></div>
  ]]
}

The `element` function is a special builder that takes the name of tag to
generate as the first argument followed by any attributes and content.

The HTML builder methods have lower precedence than any existing variables, so
if you have a variable named `div` and you want to make a `<div>` tag you'll
need to call `element "div"`.

> If you want to create a `<table>` or `<select>` tag you'll need to use
> `element` because Lua uses those names in the default global environment.

All strings passed to the HTML builder functions (attribute names, values, or
tag contents) are escaped automatically. You never have to worry about
introducing any cross site scripting vulnerabilities.

### Special attributes

The `class` attribute can be passed as a table, and the class list will be
constructed from it. The table can contain either array element, or hash
elements:

$dual_code{[[
div {
  class: {"one", "two", three: false, four: true}
}, "Hello world!"
]]}

Will generate:

```html
<div class="one two four">Hello world!</div>
```

This conversion is done by the `html.classnames` function described below.

### Helper functions

In the scope of a HTML builder function, in addition to the auto generated
functions for writing HTML tags, the following functions are also available:

* `raw(str)` -- outputs the argument, a string, directly to the buffer without escaping.
* `capture(func)` -- executes the function argument in the context of the HTML builder environment, returns the compiled result as a string instead of writing to buffer.
* `text(args)` -- outputs the argument to the buffer, escaping it if it's a string. If it's a function, it executes the function in HTML builder environment. If it's a table, it writes each item in the table
* `widget(some_widget)` -- renders another widget in the current output buffer. Automatically passes the enclosing context. The widget can either be an instance of a widget, or a widget class. If a class is provided, then an instance with no arguments is created.
* `render(template_name)` -- renders another widget or view by the module name. Lets you render etlua templates from inside builder

## HTML In Actions

If we want to generate HTML directly in our action we can use the
$self_ref{"html"} method:

$dual_code{
moon = [[
  class MyApp extends lapis.Application
    "/": =>
      @html ->
        h1 class: "header", "Hello"
        div class: "body", ->
          text "Welcome to my site!"
]],
lua = [[
  local MyApp = lapis.Application()

  MyApp:match("/", function(self)
    return self:html(function()
      h1({class = "header"}, "Hello")
      div({class = "body"}, function()
        text "Welcome to my site!"
      end)
    end)
  end)
]]
}

The environment of the function passed to $self_ref{"html"} is set to one that
support the HTML builder functions described above. The return value of the
$self_ref{"html"} method is the generated HTML as a string. Returning this from
the action allows us to render send it right to the browser

## HTML Widgets

The preferred way to write HTML is through widgets. Widgets are classes who are
only concerned with outputting HTML. Each method in the widget is executed in
the HTML builder scope that allows you to use the syntax described above to
write HTML to the response buffer.

When Lapis loads a widget automatically it does it by package name. For
example, if it was loading the widget for the name `"index"` it would try to
load the module `views.index`, and the result of that module should be the
widget.

The `Widget` class implements the class based `extend` interface that is seen
on other base classes exposed by Lapis. This is what a widget might look like:

$dual_code{
moon = [[
  -- views/index.moon
  import Widget from require "lapis.html"

  class Index extends Widget
    content: =>
      h1 class: "header", "Hello"
      div class: "body", ->
        text "Welcome to my site!"
]],
lua = [[
  -- views/index.lua
  local Widget = require("lapis.html").Widget

  local Index, Index_mt = Widget:extend("Index")

  function Index_mt:content()
    h1({class = "header"}, "Hello")
    div({class = "body"}, function()
      text "Welcome to my site!"
    end)
  end

  return Index
]]
}

> The name of the widget class is insignificant, but it's worth making one
> because some systems can auto-generate encapsulating HTML named after the
> class.


And here's the most minimal way to declare a widget, for cases when the entire
widget is a single function:

$dual_code{
moon = [[
  -- views/index.moon
  import Widget from require "lapis.html"

  Widget\extend =>
    h1 class: "header", "Hello"
    div class: "body", ->
      text "Welcome to my site!"
]],
lua = [[
  -- views/index.lua
  local Widget = require("lapis.html").Widget

  return Widget:extend(function(self)
    h1({class = "header"}, "Hello")
    div({class = "body"}, function()
      text "Welcome to my site!"
    end)
  end)
]]
}

### Rendering A Widget From An Action

The `render` option key is used to render a widget. For example you can render
the `"index"` widget from our action by returning a table with render set to
the name of the widget:

$dual_code{
  moon = [[
    "/": =>
      render: "index"
  ]],
  lua = [[
    app:match("/", function()
      return {render = "index"}
    end)
  ]]
}

If the action has a name, then we can set render to `true` to load the widget
with the same name as the action:

$dual_code{
  moon = [[
    [index: "/"]: =>
      render: true
  ]],
  lua = [[
    app:match("index", "/", function()
      return {render = "index"}
    end)
  ]]
}

By default `views.` is prepended to the widget name and then loaded
using Lua's `require` function. The `views` prefix can be customized by
overwriting the `views_prefix` member of your application subclass:


$dual_code{
moon = [[
  class Application extends lapis.Application
    views_prefix: "app_views"

    -- will use "app_views.home" as the view
    [home: "/home"]: => render: true
]],
lua = [[
  local app = lapis.Application()
  app.views_prefix = "app_views"

  app:match("home", "/", function() 
    -- will load "app_views.home" as the view
    return {render = true}
  end)

  app:match("/profile", function() 
    -- will load "app_views.profile" as the view
    return {render = "profile"}
  end)
]]
}

### Rendering A Widget From a Widget

Rendering a widget from another widget can be done via the `widget` function.
It is available in any place the [HTML builder functions](#html-builder-syntax/helper-functions) are available.

The `widget` function can either take a widget instance, or a widget class. If
a class is passed, then it is instantiated with no arguments.

$dual_code{
moon = [[
  import Widget from require "lapis.html"

  class Button extends Widget
    content: =>
      button { class: "my-button" }, @label

  class MyPage extends Widget
    content: =>
      p "Here are my buttons:"
      for i=1,5
        widget Button label: "button #{i}
]],
lua = [[
  local Widget = require("lapis.html").Widget

  local Button = Widget:extend(function(self)
    button({ class = "my-button" }, self.label)
  end)

  local MyPage = Widget:extend(function(self)
    p("Here are my buttons:")
    for i=1,5 do
      widget(Button{ label = "button" .. i })
    end
  end)
]]
}

Parameters to the sub-widgets are passed as a table to the widget's
constructor. Any values provided are copied onto the widget instance as
instance fields, meaning you can reference them on `self`


### Passing Data To A Widget

When a widget is rendered by a Lapis application request action, it
automatically will have access to any fields on the request object. Any
$self_ref{""} variables set in the action can be accessed in the widget.
Additionally any of the helper functions like $self_ref{"url_for"} are also
accessible. Lastly, sub-widgets rendered with `widget` will also inherit access
to the request object.

$dual_code{
moon = [[
  -- app.moon
  class App extends lapis.Application
    [index: "/"]: =>
      @page_title = "Welcome To My Page"
      render: true
]],
lua = [[
  -- app.lua
  local app = lapis.Application()

  app:match("index", "/", function()
    self.page_title = "Welcome To My Page"
    return {render =  true}
  end)
]]
}

$dual_code{
moon = [[
  -- views/index.moon
  import Widget from require "lapis.html"

  class Index extends Widget
    content: =>
      h1 class: "header", @page_title
      div class: "body", ->
        text "Welcome to my site!"
]],
lua = [[
  local Widget = require("lapis.html").Widget

  return Widget:extend("Index", {
    content = function(self)
      h1({class = "header"}, self.page_title)
      div({class = "body"}, function()
        text("Welcome to my site!")
      end)
    end
  })
]]
}

### Rendering Widgets Manually

Widgets can also be rendered manually by instantiating them and calling the
`render_to_string` method.

$dual_code{moon = [[
Index = require "views.index"

widget = Index page_title: "Hello World"
print widget\render_to_string!
]]}


If you want to use helpers like $self_ref{"url_for"} you also need to include
them in the widget instance. Any object can be included as a helper, and its
methods will be made available inside of the widget.

```moon
html = require "lapis.html"
class SomeWidget extends html.Widget
  content: =>
    a href: @url_for("test"), "Test Page"

class extends lapis.Application
  [test: "/test_render"]: =>
    widget = SomeWidget!
    widget\include_helper @
    widget\render_to_string!
```

You should avoid rendering widgets manually when possible. When in an action
use the `render` [request option](#request-object-request-options). When in
another widget use the `widget` helper function. Both of these methods will
ensure the same output buffer is shared to avoid unnecessary string
concatenations.

## Layouts

Whenever an action is rendered normally the result is inserted into the
current layout. The layout is just another widget, but it is used across many
pages. Typically this is where you would put your `<html>` and `<head>` tags.

Lapis comes with a default layout that looks like this:

```moon
html = require "lapis.html"

class DefaultLayout extends html.Widget
  content: =>
    html_5 ->
      head -> title @title or "Lapis Page"
      body -> @content_for "inner"
```

Use this as a starting point for creating your own layout. The content of your
page will be injected in the location of the call to `@content_for "inner"`.

We can specify the layout for an entire application or specify it for a
specific action. For example, if we have our new layout in `views/my_layout.moon`

$dual_code{
moon = [[
class extends lapis.Application
  layout: require "views.my_layout"

  -- you can also write this, and it will prepend app.views_prefix
  -- layout: = "my_layout"
]],
lua = [[
local app = lapis.Application()
app.layout = require("views.my_layout")

-- you can also write this, and it will prepend app.views_prefix
-- app.layout = "my_layout"
]]
}

If we want to set the layout for a specific action we can provide it as part of
the action's return value.

$dual_code{
moon = [[
class extends lapis.Application
  -- the following two have the same effect with the default views_prefix
  "/home1": =>
    layout: "my_layout"

  "/home2": =>
    layout: require "views.my_layout"

  -- this doesn't use a layout at all
  "/no_layout": =>
    layout: false, "No layout rendered!"
]],
lua = [[
local app = lapis.Application()

-- the following two have the same effect with the default views_prefix
app:match("/home1", function()
  return { layout = "my_layout" }
end)

app:match("/home2", function()
  return { layout = require "views.my_layout" }
end)

-- this doesn't use a layout at all
app:match("/no_layout", function()
  return { layout = false }, "No layout rendered!"
end)
]]
}

As demonstrated in the example, passing false will prevent any layout from
being rendered.

## Widget Methods

$dual_code{
moon = [[import Widget from require "lapis.html"]],
lua = [[local Widget = require("lapis.html").Widget]]
}

When sub-classing a widget, take care not to override these methods if you don't
intend to change the default behavior.

### `Widget:extend([name], fields={}, [setup_fn])`

Creates a new subclass of the `Widget` base class. The `fields` argument is a
table of properties that will be copied into the instance metatable of the
newly created class, or it can be a function and it willl be set as the
`content` field.

`name` is not directly used by Lapis but it can be helpful to provide it for
debugging and for implementing systems that derive details about the rendred
output based on the name of the widget (eg. automatically generated a class
based on the widget's name)

`setup_fn` is an optional function that will be called with the class object as
the only argument. This function is called after properties have been set but
before any `__inherited` callbacks are called. The default `Widget` class does
not have any `__inherited` callbacks so it is not necessary to use this
function unless you specifically need that behavior for a subclass you have
created.

This method returns the newly created class object, followed by the instance
metatable.

$dual_code{[[
SomeWidget = Widget\extend =>
  div "Hello world!"

print SomeWidget!\render_to_string!
]]}

### `Widget([opts])`

The default constructor of the widget class will copy every field from the
`opts` argument to `self`, if the `opts` argument is provided. You can use this
to set render-time parameters or override methods.

$dual_code{
moon = [[
  class SomeWidget extends html.Widget
    content: =>
      div "Hello ", @name

  widget = SomeWidget name: "Garf"
  print widget\render_to_string! --> <div>Hello Garf</div>
]],
lua = [[
  local Widget = require("lapis.html").Widget

  local SomeWidget = Widget:extend({
    content = function(self)
      div("Hello ", self.name)
    end
  })

  local w = SomeWidget({ name = "Garf" })
  print(widget:render_to_string()) --> <div>Hello Garf</div>
]]
}

It is safe to override the constructor and not call `super` if you want to change
the initialization conditions of your widget.

### `Widget:include(other_class)`

Makes the methods and properties from another class available on the widget
class. This can be used to implement a form a multiple inheritance for sharing
code across many widgets without having to change the parent-class.

The argument `other_class` can either be a reference to a class, or a string.
If it's a string, it will be passed to `require`. The module should return a
class to be included.

```moon
class MyHelpers
  item_list: (items) =>
    ul ->
      for item in *items
        li item

class SomeWidget extends Widget
  @include MyHelpers

  content: =>
    @item_list {"hello", "world"}
```

When including another class, the widget's class hierarchy is changed: A
dynamic *mixins* class is created exactly one level above the widget class.
This dynamically inserted class will contain all the copied fields from any
included classes. A widget will only ever have one mixins class created for it,
regardless of how many classes are included. The mixins class's parent class
will be the original parent class of the widget when it was first defined.

As an example, if given the following class hierarchy:

`LoginPage < Pages < lapis.Widget`

The first call to `include` within `LoginPage` will change the class hierarchy
to:

`LoginPage < LoginPageMixins < Pages < lapis.Widget`

The dynamically inserted class `LoginPageMixins` will contain all the fields
copied from the included classes.

Because of this organization, the following hold true:

* Any methods or properties declared directly on the widget will take precedence over any fields in the mixins class.
* `super` can be used in the widget's methods to access overrided methods in the mixin class
* The included class is able to use `super`, but it will point to the widget's original parent class, and not to a method in the hierarchy of the included class
  * If the included class is using inheritance, the hierarchy is flattened when fields are copied into the mixins class
* Because there is only one mixin class per widget class, if multiple included classes implement the same fields, they will be overwritten by subsequent calls to `include`. It is not possible to access overwritten properties


The function `is_mixins_class` from the `lapis.html` module can be used to
determine if a class is a mixins class or not.

### `widget:render_to_string()`

Renders the `content` method of a widget and returns the string result. This
will automatically create a temporary buffer for the duration of the render.
This internally calls `widget.render()` with the temporary buffer.

Keep in mind that widgets must be executed in a special scope to enable the
HTML builder functions to work. It is not possible to call the `content` method
directly on the widget if you wish to render it, you must use this method.

### `widget:render(buffer, ...)`

Renders the `content` method of the widget to the provided buffer. Under normal
circumstances it is not necessary to use this method directly. However, it's
worth noting it exists to avoid accidentally overwriting the method when
sub-classing your own widgets.

This method returns nothing.

### `widget:content_for(name, [content])`

`content_for` is used for sending HTML or strings from the view to the layout.
You've probably already seen `@content_for "inner"` if you've looked at
layouts. By default the content of the view is placed in the content block
called `"inner"`.

If `content_for` is called multiple times on the same `name`, the results will be
appended, not overwritten.

You can create arbitrary content blocks from the view by calling `@content_for`
with a name and some content:

```moon
class MyView extends Widget
  content: =>
    @content_for "title", "This is the title of my page!"

    @content_for "footer", ->
      div class: "custom_footer", "The Footer"

```

You can use either strings or builder functions as the content.

To access the content from the layout, call `@content_for` without the content
argument:

```moon
class MyLayout extends Widget
  content: =>
    html ->
      body ->
        div class: "title", ->
          @content_for "title"

        @content_for "inner"
        @content_for "footer"
```

If a string is used as the value of a content block then it will be escaped
before written to the buffer. If you want to insert a raw string then you can
use a builder function in conjunction with the `raw` function:

```moon
@content_for "footer", ->
  raw "<pre>this wont' be escaped</pre>"
```

### `widget:has_content_for(name)`

Checks to see if content for `name` is set.

```moon
class MyView extends Widget
  content: =>
    if @has_content_for "things"
      @content_for "things"
    else
      div ->
        text "default content"
```

## HTML Module

```moon
html = require "lapis.html"
```

### `html.Widget`

The Widget base class for creating templates in code as a class. See the [HTML
Widgets](#html-widgets) for a full guide on using the Widget class.

$dual_code{
moon = [[
import Widget from require "lapis.html"

class IndexPage extends Widget
  content: =>
    div "Hello!"
]],
lua = [[
local html = require("lapis.html")

local IndexPage = html.Widget:extend("IndexPage", {
  content = function(self)
    div("Hello!")
  end
})
]]
}

### `html.render_html(fn)`

Runs the function, `fn` in the HTML rendering context as described above.
Returns the resulting HTML as a string.

$dual_code{
moon = [[
import render_html from require "lapis.html"

print render_html ->
  div class: "item", ->
    strong "Hello!"

--> <div class="item"><strong>Hello!</strong></div>
]],
lua = [[
local html = require("lapis.html")

print(html.render_html(function()
  div({class = "item"}, function()
    strong("Hello!")
  end)
end)) --> <div class="item"><strong>Hello!</strong></div>
]]
}

### `html.escape(str)`

Escapes any HTML special characters in the string. The following are escaped:

 * `&` -- `&amp;`
 * `<` -- `&lt;`
 * `>` -- `&gt;`
 * `"` -- `&quot;`
 * `'` -- `&#039;`

### `html.classnames(t)`

Converts a nested Lua table into a HTML class attribute string. Passing a
string to this function will return the string unmodified.

This function is applied to the value of the class attribute when using the
HTML builder syntax.

$dual_code{
moon = [[
classnames({
  "one"
  "two"
  yes: true
  {skipped: false, haveit: true, "", "last"}
}) --> "one two yes haveit last"
]],
lua = [[
classnames({
  "one",
  "two",
  yes = true,
  {
    skipped = false,
    haveit = true,
    "",
    "last"
  }
}) --> "one two yes haveit last"
]]
}


### `html.is_mixins_class(obj)`

Returns `true` if the argument `obj` is an auto-generated mixin class that
is inserted into the class hierarchy of a widget when `Widget:include` is
called.

```moon
html = require "lapis.html"

class MyHelpers
  say_hi: => div "hi"

class SomeWidget extends html.Widget
  @include MyHelpers
  content: => @say_hi!

print html.is_mixins_class(SomeWidget.__parent) --> true

```
